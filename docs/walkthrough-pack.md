## choose-something-else-to-learn — Choose something else to learn

Personas: learner · place: library

1. [`library-course-search` · next] Everything you can get to lives below, and this box is the quick way in. Type a language and the list narrows as you go.
2. [`library-course-grid` · next] Tap any one of these and you are straight into it — no setting up, no starting over.
3. [`library-course-grid` · next] Your current course is not going anywhere. Each one keeps its own place, so you can have a poke at a second language and come back without losing an inch in the first.
   - terminal: That's the Library. Close it and press play to carry on with the one you are in.

## go-back-over-something — Go back over something

Personas: learner · place: library

1. [`library-belt-browser` · click] Nothing is ever locked behind you. Tap here to open the whole course up.
2. [`belt-browser-list` · next] Every belt is listed, with a tick on the ones you have already come through. Open one and you can look through everything you met there.
3. [`belt-browser-list` · next] Choosing something in there does not just show it to you — it moves you to that point and starts you off from there. So use it when you genuinely want to go over old ground, not to peek.
   - terminal: If you land somewhere you did not mean to, come straight back in here and pick your way forward again. Nothing is lost by wandering.

## hand-over-the-lead — Hand a class over to another teacher

Personas: teacher · place: class-detail

1. [`class-teachers` · next] One teacher on a class is the **lead** — the one the class is listed under, and the one a school admin comes to about it. When you move on from a class, that name should move too.
2. [`class-teacher-make-lead` · next] **Make lead** hands it to a colleague already on the class. It takes effect straight away, so add them first and hand over once you have.
3. [`class-teachers` · next] Nothing else moves. The pupils, their progress and every session stay exactly where they are, and you stay on the class as a teacher — you have passed the lead, not left.
   - terminal: That's handover — the lead is a name, not a wall. Nothing changed while you read this; only your own taps do.

## install-the-app — Put the app on your device

Personas: leader · place: node-home (org/group/school)

1. [`account-card` · next] **Your account** holds the two things that are about you rather than your organisation: your sign-in, and the app on the device you are holding.
2. [`account-install` · next] This row already knows what device you are on. On a computer it offers to install the app in its own window; on a phone it offers to add it to your home screen. Same organisation either way — it just saves you finding the tab.
3. [`account-install` · next] If your browser can do it in one tap, the button does it. If it cannot, the button walks you through your browser's own menu instead — and you can remove the app again any time, like any other app.
   - terminal: Nothing here is one-time — if you said no on your first visit, this row is still waiting whenever you change your mind.

## invite-a-supply-teacher — Invite a teacher who isn't here yet

Personas: teacher · place: class-detail

1. [`class-teachers` · next] Use this when the colleague has no account yet — a supply teacher starting on Monday, or someone new to the school. It saves waiting for an admin to add them first.
2. [`class-coteacher-link` · next] **Create a co-teacher link** mints a fresh link the moment you tap it. Whoever opens it lands as a teacher of this class, and of this school — not as its lead, and not over any of your other classes.
3. [`class-join-link` · next] Keep it apart from this one. This is the **student** link — anyone who opens it joins the class as a learner. One link makes a colleague, the other makes a pupil, so send them to the right people.
   - terminal: Short version: the teacher link is minted per colleague and puts them beside you, the student link is the standing one for the class. This tour minted nothing.

## invite-first-person — Bring your first person in

Personas: admin, leader · place: node-home (org)

1. [`verb-invite-person` · click] People join through here — tap **Invite a person**. Nothing is created until you submit the form.
2. [`invite-form-role` · next] Pick **Group leader** for someone who will run a group of their own, or **Learner** for someone who is here to learn. The link carries the role with it, so they arrive already belonging to this group.
3. [`invite-form-submit` · next] With their name filled in, this mints their own sign-in link — the account exists the moment you tap, and the link IS their login. No sign-up, no password. Send it any way you like.
4. [`ways-in-ledger` · next] Every link you mint lands here in **Ways in** — you can revoke it or re-mint it any time. Re-minting kills the old link on the spot.
   - terminal: That's the whole flow — the link is their login. This tour minted nothing; only your own taps do.

## invite-first-teacher — Bring your first teacher in

Personas: admin, leader, school_admin · place: node-home (school)

1. [`verb-invite-person` · click] People join through here — tap **Invite a person**. Nothing is created until you submit the form.
2. [`invite-form-role` · next] Pick **Teacher** — the link carries the role with it, so whoever clicks it arrives as a teacher of this school.
3. [`invite-form-submit` · next] With their name filled in, this mints their own sign-in link — the account exists the moment you tap, and the link IS their login. Send it any way you like.
4. [`ways-in-ledger` · next] Every link you mint lands here in **Ways in** — you can revoke it or re-mint it any time. Re-minting kills the old link on the spot.
   - terminal: That's the whole flow — the link is their login. This tour minted nothing; only your own taps do.

## invites-desk — The invites desk

Personas: admin · place: admin-invites

1. [`invites-mode-strip` · next] Three ways to mint access, one form: **Into an organisation** (role links into the tree), **Direct access** (codes and magic links), **New demo org** (a full practice tree).
2. [`invites-org-who` · next] **Who** silently changes what the submit button does: some options mint a FRESH link, others surface the STANDING link that already exists. Watch the button label switch as you change this.
3. [`invites-org-submit` · next] Every submit on this desk mints REAL access the moment you tap — a leaked leader link makes a stranger a group leader. This tour never taps it for you.
4. [`invites-active-toggle` · next] This pill is not just a badge — tapping it is a live kill-switch. It disables or re-enables the link across all four underlying access mechanisms at once.
   - terminal: Rule of the desk: look before you mint — everything here is live the moment it exists.

## move-a-teacher-between-classes — Move a teacher to another class

Personas: teacher · place: class-detail

1. [`class-teachers` · next] **Teachers** answers 'who teaches this class?'. A head usually wants the other direction too — 'which classes does this person take?' — and that is the same question read backwards.
2. [`class-teacher-other-classes` · click] **Other classes** on anyone's row asks it that way round. It never moves anybody on its own — it opens a list for you to change.
3. [`assign-classes-list` · next] Every class in the school, with the ones this teacher already takes already ticked. Ticking a second, or a third, is all 'belonging to several classes' means — there is no separate step for it.
4. [`assign-classes-list` · next] A move is just both at once: tick where they are going, untick where they are leaving. You are looking at the truth before you change it, so nothing here is a guess.
5. [`assign-classes-save` · next] Saving applies only the boxes you actually changed. If one of them fails, it says which class failed and why, rather than claiming everything saved.
   - terminal: That's moving a teacher — one untick, one tick, one save. This tour changed nothing; only your own taps do.

## reading-insights — Reading your insights

Personas: admin, leader, school_admin · place: node-insights

1. [`insights-measure` · next] The **measure** picks what's being counted — progress, practice, class sessions. The line underneath the pickers says exactly what the current one means.
2. [`insights-window` · next] The **window** is the period the rate is computed over — shorter windows react faster, longer ones smooth the noise.
3. [`insights-compare` · next] **Compare to** puts an average alongside. Everything here is a rate, not a raw total — so groups of different sizes compare fairly.
4. [`insights-overview` · next] **Overview** takes you back to the same place's home — insights is a lens on where you already are, not a different page to get lost in.
   - terminal: Rates lead, position is context — and the picker text always says what a measure means.

## reading-the-course-list — Reading the course list

Personas: learner · place: library

1. [`library-course-card` · next] Each card names the language you would be learning, and under it, the language it would be taught in. That second line is the one worth reading — it is what you will hear the prompts in.
2. [`library-course-card` · next] The right-hand side tells you where you stand. A coloured dot and a position means you have already started that one and it is holding your place for you.
3. [`library-course-card` · next] **Premium** with **Try free** next to it means the course is a paid one, and that you can properly get going in it first. You carry on until the app asks — nothing stops you mid-thought and nothing is taken before you have said yes.
4. [`library-course-grid` · next] Some languages offer more than one card — a different region or accent of the same language. Pick whichever you would rather end up sounding like.
   - terminal: Nothing here commits you. Tapping a card takes you into it, and every course you have touched keeps its own place waiting.

## run-class-session — Run your first class session

Personas: teacher · place: class-detail

1. [`class-join-link` · next] Students join with this link — share it and they sign up straight into this class.
2. [`class-join-code` · next] Prefer a whiteboard? **Show code instead** reveals a standing code — anyone who enters it at saysomethingin.com/redeem joins this class, until the code changes.
3. [`class-play` · next] **Play as class** is the heart of it: one device — yours — leads the whole class through a session, and it counts for every student on the roster.
   - terminal: When you're ready, tap Play as class for real — this tour never starts a session for you.

## save-your-progress — Save your progress

Personas: learner · place: library (guest)

1. [`library-save-progress` · next] Right now everything you have done lives on this device alone. It works perfectly well — but a cleared browser or a new phone takes it with it.
2. [`library-save-progress` · next] Tap this and you give us an email address, nothing more. We send you a code, you type it in, and your position is yours on any device you sign in on.
   - terminal: Everything you have already done comes with you — signing in adds your account to it, it never starts you again.

## set-your-password — Set or change your password

Personas: leader · place: node-home (org/group/school)

1. [`account-card` · next] **Your account** is your own corner of this page — not the organisation's, yours. Your sign-in and your device live here, and nothing in it is visible to anyone you have invited.
2. [`account-password` · next] If you arrived through a **link in an email**, that link will not last forever. A password is how you get back into your organisation from a new laptop, a new phone, or after clearing your browser.
3. [`account-password` · next] Tap **Set a password** and the form opens right here. You will sign in with your email address and that password from then on — and you can come back and change it any time.
   - terminal: That is the whole thing — one password, always changeable, always in the same place.

## share-a-class — Share a class with a colleague

Personas: teacher · place: class-detail

1. [`class-teachers` · next] A class does not have to be yours alone. **Teachers** lists everyone who teaches it, with the lead marked — a job share, a department colleague, a supply teacher covering for a fortnight.
2. [`class-teacher-add` · click] **Add another teacher** is how you share it. Nobody is added until you pick a name and confirm.
3. [`class-teacher-picker` · next] You can pick anyone already teaching at your school. If the list is empty, your colleague has not joined the school yet — the link underneath brings them straight in.
4. [`class-teachers` · next] What they get is the whole class: the roster, the sessions, the progress, and the right to run a class session. What they do not get is the lead — that stays with you until you hand it over.
   - terminal: That's sharing a class — same class, two teachers, one lead. This tour added nobody; only your own taps do.

## ways-in — Ways in — who can get in, and how to change it

Personas: admin, leader, school_admin · place: node-home (org/group/school)

1. [`ways-in-ledger` · next] Every way in, in one ledger: personal sign-in links and shareable join links, for everywhere below here. Filter by role or by place with the chips.
2. [`ways-in-copy` · next] **Copy** re-shares the same live link — always safe, nothing changes.
3. [`ways-in-remint` · next] **Re-mint** is the one to know about: it mints a NEW link and the old one stops working the moment you tap — anyone who bookmarked the old link is locked out until you send them the new one.
4. [`ways-in-revoke` · next] **Revoke** switches a link off. It's undoable — a revoked row grows a **Put back** button.
   - terminal: The short version: copy is safe, re-mint kills the old link instantly, revoke can always be undone.

## what-your-numbers-mean — What your numbers mean

Personas: learner · place: library

1. [`library-activity-stats` · next] These three are a record of what you have already done. None of them is a target, and none of them is being compared with anybody.
2. [`library-stat-total-time` · next] Time is the time you have actually spent learning. If it ever shows a **~** in front of it, that is us working it out from how far along you are, because we have not logged the sessions themselves.
3. [`library-stat-phrases` · next] Phrases is how many you have said out loud. It counts the sessions this device still remembers, so treat it as a recent tally rather than a lifetime one.
   - terminal: Nothing here changes what you get next. The course follows your position, not these numbers.

## where-you-are-in-this-course — Where you are in this course

Personas: learner · place: library

1. [`library-progress-card` · next] This card is your whole position in the course in one glance. Nothing here is a score, and nothing here is counting anything against you.
2. [`library-belt-strip` · next] Those eight coloured dots are **belts**, and the filled one is where you are now. A belt marks how far along the course you have come — it is a position, not a grade, and there is nothing to pass. You move to the next one simply by carrying on.
3. [`library-position-track` · next] The bar underneath lays the whole course out end to end, with each belt as its own band of colour. The marker on it is you — so it shows how far you have come rather than how far is left.
4. [`library-belt-browser` · next] Tap the card itself to open the belts up. You can look through everything you have met so far, and start again from any point you fancy revisiting.
   - terminal: That's your position. Close this whenever you like and press play — it always picks up exactly where you left off.
