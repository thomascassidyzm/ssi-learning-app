# SSi Methodology Documentation

> Central repository for SSi learning methodology specifications.
> As Aran noted: "You can just add this kind of data dump to Claude's files and it never gets lost or forgotten."

## Documents

| File | Status | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| [listening-layers.md](./listening-layers.md) | Design | Layer 1 (reactivation) and Layer 2 (acquisition) listening system |

## Adding New Methodology

When capturing methodology insights:

1. Create a new markdown file in this directory
2. Include source attribution and date
3. Structure with clear sections: Purpose, Behavior, Parameters
4. Note implementation considerations
5. List open questions/TBDs

## Related APML Specs

The methodology docs inform the APML specifications in `/apml/`:
- `learning/spaced-repetition.apml` - Fibonacci decay system
- `learning/triple-helix.apml` - Thread interleaving
- `learning/listening-layers.apml` - Layer 1/Layer 2 listening system
- `learning/adaptation-engine.apml` - Real-time difficulty adjustment
- `learning/phrase-selection.apml` - Phrase selection algorithm

*This directory serves as the "methodology file" Aran mentioned - a persistent record of learning design decisions that informs implementation.*
